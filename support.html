        <h1>MailSense Support</h1>

        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 18, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of this page</h2>
        <p>This page explains how you can contact the MailSense operator for support and what you can generally expect from the support process.</p>
        <p>This page does not change your legal rights. Your relationship with the MailSense operator is governed by the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>2. How to contact support</h2>
        <div class="contact-box">
            <h3>Primary support contact</h3>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:mailsense@callhomerealty.com">mailsense@callhomerealty.com</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>In the future, the MailSense operator may provide an in-app support feature or a contact form. Any additional method will be shown inside the app or on this page.</p>

        <h2>3. What support can help with</h2>
        <p>You may contact support about:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>account and connection issues, including linking or unlinking your email account</li>
            <li>technical problems such as crashes, bugs, or unexpected behavior</li>
            <li>billing questions related to paid plans and subscriptions</li>
            <li>privacy-related requests, such as questions about the Privacy Policy or requests allowed by law regarding your personal data</li>
            <li>general feedback or suggestions about MailSense</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some requests, especially privacy-related requests, may require identity verification before the operator can act.</p>

        <h2>4. Response expectations</h2>
        <p>Support response times can vary.</p>
        <p>The MailSense operator aims to respond to most messages within a reasonable period, for example within a few business days, but does not guarantee a specific response time or outcome.</p>
        <p>For possible security incidents involving your account, you may use a subject line such as "Security issue" to help with triage. This does not create an emergency service obligation.</p>

        <h2>5. Information to include in a request</h2>
        <p>To help support investigate and respond efficiently, please include when possible:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the email address of the account connected to MailSense</li>
            <li>your device type and operating system version</li>
            <li>the approximate time the issue occurred</li>
            <li>a description of what you were doing when the issue happened</li>
            <li>screenshots or exact error messages, if available</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For privacy requests, clearly state what you are asking for, for example access, correction, or deletion, and provide enough detail for support to identify the relevant data.</p>

        <h2>6. Handling of sensitive information</h2>
        <p>Email is not ideal for very sensitive content.</p>
        <p>For your protection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>do not send passwords or full credit card numbers in support emails</li>
            <li>do not forward entire mailboxes or large sets of messages unless support specifically asks you to do so and you are comfortable sharing those emails</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If more detailed information is needed, support will explain what is needed and may suggest a safer method of providing that information where possible.</p>

        <h2>7. Links to legal documents</h2>
        <p>For full details of how MailSense handles data and what terms apply to your use of the app, please review:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are available on the MailSense legal site or any other locations the operator designates in the app.</p>
        <p>If there is any conflict between this Support page and those documents, the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service will control.</p>
