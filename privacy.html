        <h1>Privacy Policy for MailSense</h1>

        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 1, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Scope of this Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how MailSense and the MailSense operator collect, use, and share information when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use the MailSense mobile application</li>
            <li>visit the MailSense legal and support pages that the operator makes available for the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Policy does not apply to any other websites or services that may be linked from these pages. Those services have their own policies.</p>
        <p>MailSense is an e mail and meeting assistant that connects to your e mail account and presents information in a private interface for individual users.</p>
        <p>By installing or using MailSense, or by visiting the MailSense legal or support pages, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you should not use MailSense.</p>

        <h2>2. Controller and contact details</h2>
        <p>For personal data covered by this Policy, the MailSense operator acts as the data controller.</p>
        <h3>Contact for privacy questions or requests</h3>
        <p>Email: mailsense at callhomerealty dot com</p>
        <p>The legal name, address, and registration details of the MailSense operator are maintained in the operator records and can be added by counsel if needed.</p>

        <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>MailSense can access and process several categories of information. Some information is provided directly by you and some is obtained through your e mail provider when you connect the app.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Information from Google sign in</h3>
        <p>When you connect MailSense to your Google account, MailSense may receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your Google account e mail address</li>
            <li>basic profile information such as display name and profile image</li>
            <li>technical identifiers and tokens that allow MailSense to access the Gmail application programming interface on your behalf</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3A. Google account access</h3>
        <p>MailSense connects to your Google account using Google OAuth. When you choose to connect, MailSense requests only the permissions needed to provide its features, which currently include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>basic Google profile information such as your name and e mail address</li>
            <li>read only access to your Gmail messages and related metadata</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MailSense does not request permission to send e mail, delete e mail, change Gmail settings, or manage your contacts.</p>
        <p>You can choose at any time not to connect a Google account. If you do not connect a Google account, MailSense cannot read any of your Gmail data.</p>

        <h3>3.2 E mail content and metadata</h3>
        <p>Through the permissions you grant, MailSense may access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>e mail headers such as sender, recipients, subject, date, and message identifiers</li>
            <li>e mail body content in order to analyze and display messages in the app</li>
            <li>label and folder information that helps organize messages</li>
            <li>attachments, but only where necessary to support visible features in the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MailSense uses Gmail data only in order to provide the features described in this Policy. MailSense uses Gmail data in accordance with the Google application programming interface Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
        <p>MailSense reads messages and metadata but does not send messages, delete messages, or modify labels or folders in your Gmail account.</p>

            <li>names, e mail addresses, and phone numbers</li>
            <li>job titles, company names, and websites</li>
            <li>other contact information included in signature blocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These data are used to show and manage your own contact views in the app. MailSense does not create a public contact directory.</p>

        <h3>3.5 Device and diagnostic data</h3>
        <p>When you use the app, MailSense may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>device type, operating system version, language settings, and region</li>
            <li>app version and configuration data</li>
            <li>diagnostic information such as crash logs, error reports, and basic analytics for performance and reliability</li>

        <h3>3.6 Communication preferences</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Legal and safety reasons</h3>

        <h2>7. Marketing and communication choices</h2>
        <p>MailSense distinguishes between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>service communication</strong>, meaning messages about security, account changes, and important updates that are necessary for the app</li>
            <li><strong>marketing communication</strong>, meaning optional messages such as tips, feature announcements, and upgrade offers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Marketing e mails are sent only where allowed by law and only if you have given clear consent or where the law otherwise permits.</p>
        <p>You can opt out of marketing e mails at any time by using the unsubscribe link in those messages or by e mailing mailsense at callhomerealty dot com. Opting out of marketing does not stop service messages and does not remove access to any existing plan.</p>

        <h2>8. User rights and controls</h2>
        <p>The rights that apply to your personal data depend on where you live and which privacy laws apply to the MailSense operator and to you.</p>
        <p>The operator will handle requests in a reasonable way and within the limits of applicable law. In some cases, a request may be refused or only partly granted.</p>
        <p>Subject to applicable law, you may be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ask whether the operator processes personal data about you and, where required, receive a summary of that data</li>
            <li>ask for correction of inaccurate information that you cannot correct yourself</li>
            <li>ask for deletion of personal data, subject to the need to keep certain information for legal, security, or business reasons</li>
            <li>ask the operator to limit or object to some processing, especially for direct marketing</li>
            <li>ask, where required by law and technically feasible, to receive certain data in a structured, commonly used format</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority or similar regulator in your region if you believe your rights have been violated.</p>
        <p>To contact the operator about privacy rights, e mail mailsense at callhomerealty dot com with a clear description of your request. The operator may ask for additional information to confirm your identity and to clarify what you are asking it to do.</p>
        <p>The operator may decline or limit your request where law allows or requires that result, including where a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or would adversely affect the rights of another person.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>The MailSense operator uses reasonable technical and organizational measures intended to protect personal data against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>These measures may include encryption in transit, access controls, and vendor security reviews. No system can be guaranteed completely secure.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>The MailSense operator may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
        <p>If changes are material, a notice will be provided in the app or on the legal pages with a new Last updated date. Your continued use of MailSense after the effective date of any change means you accept the updated Policy.</p>

        <h2>12. Compliance with Google policies</h2>
