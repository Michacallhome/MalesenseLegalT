        <h1>MailSense Support</h1>

        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 3, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of this page</h2>
        <p>This page explains how you can contact the MailSense operator for support and what you can generally expect from the support process.</p>
        <p>This page does not change your legal rights. Your relationship with the MailSense operator is governed by the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>Is MailSense meant to replace my Mail app or inbox</h3>
        <p>No. MailSense is not a replacement for your email app. It is a must have companion that works alongside your regular inbox. MailSense scans your messages and digital meetings, surfaces the most important items in one place, and helps you act on them faster without changing how you send or receive mail. Think of it as a personal assistant that keeps an eye on your important emails and meeting invites for you.</p>

        <h3>Why does the app feel slow on first launch</h3>
        <p>On first use MailSense needs to securely connect to your mail account and scan your recent messages and meeting invites. This usually takes about thirty seconds to one minute depending on connection speed and mailbox size. After that first pass, syncs are much faster.</p>

        <h2>3. How to contact support</h2>
        <div class="contact-box">
            <h3>Primary support contact</h3>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:mailsense@callhomerealty.com">mailsense@callhomerealty.com</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>In the future, the MailSense operator may provide an in-app support feature or a contact form. Any additional method will be shown inside the app or on this page.</p>

        <h2>4. What support can help with</h2>
        <p>You may contact support about:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>account and connection issues, including linking or unlinking your email account</li>
            <li>technical problems such as crashes, bugs, or unexpected behavior</li>
            <li>billing questions related to paid plans and subscriptions</li>
            <li>privacy-related requests, such as questions about the Privacy Policy or requests allowed by law regarding your personal data</li>
            <li>general feedback or suggestions about MailSense</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some requests, especially privacy-related requests, may require identity verification before the operator can act.</p>

        <h2>5. Response expectations</h2>
        <p>Support response times can vary.</p>
        <p>The MailSense operator aims to respond to most messages within a reasonable period, for example within a few business days, but does not guarantee a specific response time or outcome.</p>
        <p>For possible security incidents involving your account, you may use a subject line such as "Security issue" to help with triage. This does not create an emergency service obligation.</p>

        <h2>6. Information to include in a request</h2>
        <p>To help support investigate and respond efficiently, please include when possible:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the email address of the account connected to MailSense</li>
            <li>your device type and operating system version</li>
            <li>the approximate time the issue occurred</li>
            <li>a description of what you were doing when the issue happened</li>
            <li>screenshots or exact error messages, if available</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For privacy requests, clearly state what you are asking for, for example access, correction, or deletion, and provide enough detail for support to identify the relevant data.</p>

        <h2>7. Handling of sensitive information</h2>
        <p>Email is not ideal for very sensitive content.</p>
        <p>For your protection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>do not send passwords or full credit card numbers in support emails</li>
            <li>do not forward entire mailboxes or large sets of messages unless support specifically asks you to do so and you are comfortable sharing those emails</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If more detailed information is needed, support will explain what is needed and may suggest a safer method of providing that information where possible.</p>

        <h2>8. Links to legal documents</h2>
        <p>For full details of how MailSense handles data and what terms apply to your use of the app, please review:</p>

            <li><a href="MailSensePrivacySummary.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="MailSenseTerms.html">Terms of Service</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are available on the MailSense legal site or any other locations the operator designates in the app.</p>
        <p>If there is any conflict between this Support page and those documents, the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service will control.</p>
