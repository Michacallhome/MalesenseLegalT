        <h1>Terms of Service for MailSense</h1>

        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 18, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement and acceptance</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service are a legal agreement between you and the MailSense operator. They govern your use of the MailSense application and any related services that the operator makes available for the app.</p>
        <p>By installing, accessing, or using MailSense, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the app.</p>
        <p>If you use MailSense on behalf of another person or organization, you represent that you have authority to accept these Terms for that person or organization.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of MailSense and important limitations</h2>
        <p>MailSense is an assistive tool that connects to your email account and provides features such as:</p>

            <li>showing extracted contact information based on your email history</li>
        </ol>
        <p>MailSense is intended as a convenience layer. It does not replace:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>your primary email client</li>
            <li>your primary calendar</li>
            <li>any professional advice or any official record</li>

            <li>confirming information shown in MailSense by reviewing the original message or source</li>
        </ol>
        <p>MailSense may miss, delay, or misclassify messages, meetings, and other items. You must not rely on MailSense as your only source of information for any critical matter.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility and account security</h2>

            <li>promptly taking action with your email provider if you suspect unauthorized access to your email account</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The MailSense operator is not responsible for any loss that results from your failure to protect your device or credentials.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>use MailSense in any way that violates any law or the rights of any person</li>
            <li>interfere with the operation of MailSense or attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or accounts</li>
            <li>attempt to reverse engineer or decompile the app except where this is expressly permitted by law that cannot be contracted out of</li>

            <li>use MailSense to send spam, abusive content, or any content that is unlawful or harmful</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The MailSense operator may suspend or terminate your access to MailSense at its discretion if it believes that you have violated these rules or that your use creates risk for the operator, for other users, or for third parties.</p>

        <h2>5. License and intellectual property</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the MailSense operator grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use MailSense on a device that you own or control, solely for your personal use and only as permitted by these Terms and by the rules of the platform where you obtained the app.</p>
        <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to MailSense, including all software, design, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks, are owned by the MailSense operator or its licensors. Except for the limited license described above, no rights are granted to you.</p>
        <p>You may not:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>copy or modify MailSense except as allowed by the rules of the platform where you obtained it</li>
            <li>remove or alter any proprietary notices that appear in the app</li>
            <li>use any MailSense name or logo in a way that suggests endorsement or affiliation without written permission from the operator</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>6. Free and paid plans</h2>
        <p>MailSense may be offered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>as a free plan with limits on features, usage, or the number of accounts you can connect</li>
            <li>as one or more paid plans that provide additional features or higher limits for a fee</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Specific prices, billing cycles, plan names, and plan features will be shown in the app or on a related website. Those details form part of these Terms and may be adjusted by the operator from time to time.</p>
        <p>If you use a paid plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>you authorize the app store or payment provider to charge the applicable fees, taxes, and similar charges using the payment method you provide</li>
            <li>subscriptions may renew automatically at the end of each period unless you cancel in accordance with the rules of the app store or payment provider</li>
            <li>if you cancel, you usually retain access through the end of the paid period, after which your access may revert to a free plan if one is available or may end</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Refunds are usually handled by the app store or payment provider under their own policies. The MailSense operator has only the refund obligations that those policies and applicable law require.</p>
        <p>When a paid plan ends, the MailSense operator may:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>remove or suspend access to paid features</li>
            <li>downgrade your account to a free plan if one is available</li>
            <li>delete or archive data that relates only to paid features after a reasonable time, subject to legal retention requirements and to the Privacy Policy</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>7. Service changes, suspension, and termination</h2>
        <p>MailSense will change over time. To the extent permitted by law, the MailSense operator may at any time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>add, remove, or change features</li>
            <li>limit the app or stop offering it in some regions</li>
            <li>suspend or terminate the app or any part of it</li>

        </ol>
